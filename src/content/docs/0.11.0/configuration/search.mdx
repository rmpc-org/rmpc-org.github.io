## search\_button

<ConfigValue name="search_button" type="bool" />

Display a dedicated search button in the search from when set to true. Otherwise the search is triggered
on every change. Defaults to `false`.

## custom\_query

<ConfigValue name="custom_query" type="bool" />

Displays an input allowing you to input a fully custom query as specified by [MPD's protocol](https://mpd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html#filters).
All tag filters will be ignored if this query is specified. Only settings that work with this are
case sensitivity, diacritics stripping and the rating filters.
Defaults to `false`.

Examples:

* `artist == "Epica"`
* `(artist == "Epica") AND (album == "The Phantom Agony")`

:::caution
Do not use this unless you are *really* sure you know what you are doing. This will result in errors if you
input a malformed query. You are on your own, do not report issues about this unless it is really broken.

## mode

<ConfigValue name="mode" type={["Exact", "NotExact", "StartsWith", "Contains", "Regex", "NotRegex"]} />

What kind if filter to use by default. `NotExact` and `NotRegex` are negation of `Exact` and `Regex`
respectively. Default is `Contains`.

## tags

<ConfigValue name="tags" customText="<(label: <string>, value: <string>)[]>" />

Array of tags to list as searchable on the Search pane. Each tag consists of a label and value.
If not specified, the [default values](/0.11.0/reference/config) are used. If empty array is passed,
a value of `[(label: "Any Tag", value: "any")]` will be used instead. For a list of supported tags
refer to [MPD's documentation](https://mpd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html#tags). Special
tag `any` will check all possible tags.
